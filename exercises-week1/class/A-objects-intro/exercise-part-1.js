/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

var user = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "johnsmith@gmail.com"
};
console.log(user);
