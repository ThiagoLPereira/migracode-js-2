## Notes about Week 1 Exercises

There are some exercises for which I am showing you 2 different ways of solving: 1) with loops, 2) with filter and map functions. These exercises are:
* From class: Exercise 2 from E: Arrays of Objects section
* Homework Exercise 4
* Homework Exercise 5

**Homework Exercise 8** was quite unclear, so I have rewritten the exercise so that it prints expected result and actual result at each step. This new question file as at /homework/exercise-8.js. The solution to this exercise is at /homework/exercise-8-solved.js.
