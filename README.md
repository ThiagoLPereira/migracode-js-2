# Migracode JavaScript 2 Exercises & Solutions

This repository contains the exercises and solutions for the JS 2 module of Migracode Barcelona. Solutions provided by Jay Nebhwani.

## Notes about Week 1 Exercises

There are some exercises for which I am showing you 2 different ways of solving: 1) with loops, 2) with filter and map functions. These exercises have 2 files, one explaining each way of solving:
* Class Exercise 2 from E: Arrays of Objects section
* Homework Exercise 4
* Homework Exercise 5

**Homework Exercise 8** was quite unclear, so I have rewritten it so that it prints the expected result and the actual result at each step. This new question file is at /homework/exercise-8.js. Please attempt it again if you found it unclear during the class.

The solution to this exercise is at /homework/exercise-8-solved.js.
